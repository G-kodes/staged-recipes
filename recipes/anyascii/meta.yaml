  summary: 'Unicode to ASCII transliteration - Python'
  description: |
    Converts Unicode text to a reasonable representation using only ASCII.
    For most characters in Unicode, AnyAscii provides an ASCII-only replacement string.
    Text is converted character-by-character without considering the context. The mappings
    for each script are based on popular existing romanization schemes. Symbolic characters
    are converted based on their meaning or appearance. All ASCII characters in the input are
    left unchanged, every other character is replaced with printable ASCII characters.
    Unknown characters are removed.
